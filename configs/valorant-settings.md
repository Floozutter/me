# Valorant Settings
## Hardware
Mouse DPI is set at default to 800.

One button on my mouse cycles the DPI from 800 -> 1600 -> 6400 -> 800,
and another button resets the DPI directly to 800,
but I never use those buttons anyway.

## System
[Valorant (Unreal Engine 4) apparently uses raw input](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/ffit9j//fjz8tk9/)
so it shouldn't matter but...

I like setting pointer speed to 5/10 (6/11) with acceleration (enhance pointer precision) off anyway.
